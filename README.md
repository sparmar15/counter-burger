# Counter Burger Design Pattern
This is a java project that prints out the check at "The Counter: Burger Restaurant" using Design Patterns. This code uses Composite Design Pattern which creates a tree-like structure where objects can be treated as a group or as an individual. This was a small lab I worked on for the subject "CMPE 202: Software Systems Engineering". The main aim of this lab was to get a better insight on how to code using Design Patterns to implement real world examples.
